2. **Reduced Data Processing Overhead:**
   - Discuss how utilizing measurements from a centralized point minimizes the need for extensive data processing and communication between multiple nodes.
   - Highlight that the streamlined data flow contributes to reduced computational overhead, making your approach computationally efficient.

3. **Real-time Processing:**
   - If applicable, mention the real-time processing capabilities of your protection scheme. 
   - Explain how the use of measurements from a single point allows for quicker decision-making, enhancing the overall responsiveness of the microgrid protection system.

4. **Algorithmic Efficiency:**
   - Discuss any algorithmic optimizations or efficiency measures implemented in your machine learning models.
   - If your models are designed for quick inference, highlight this aspect and provide evidence or comparative metrics demonstrating their computational efficiency.

5. **Comparison with Existing Models:**
   - If applicable, compare the computational time of your proposed scheme with existing models or methodologies in the literature.
   - Provide quantitative results or metrics that showcase the efficiency gains achieved by your approach.

6. **Scalability Considerations:**
