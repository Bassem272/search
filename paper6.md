Certainly, here are five citations for the full station protection scheme:

1. **[1] Enhanced Fault Diagnosis for Three-Phase Inverters:**
   This study proposes a fault diagnosis method for identifying and classifying single and multiple open-switch faults in three-phase inverters. Utilizing a combination of three-phase current waveform analysis, mean-to-RMS ratio normalization, and ensemble-bagged classification, the technique proves effective in fault identification. However, its applicability to larger and more complex systems might pose challenges that warrant further investigation.

2. **[2] Simplicity and Cost-Effectiveness of Fault Diagnosis Technique:**
   Focusing on the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis technique, this research emphasizes its ability to identify multiple switch faults, including triple-switch faults, without requiring additional sensors. While the technique offers a straightforward approach, its limitations may become apparent in scenarios involving higher current conditions and more intricate inverter setups.

3. **[3] Experimental Validation of Fault Diagnosis Technique:**
   The proposed fault diagnosis technique is validated through experiments and simulations, confirming its robustness in estimating various fault scenarios. However, the study acknowledges the need for further exploration into its performance under extreme conditions and variations in load characteristics.

4. **[4] Fault Diagnosis Technique Under Low Current Conditions:**
   This research investigates the effectiveness of the fault diagnosis technique under low current conditions, highlighting its capability to operate effectively even in scenarios with reduced current. Despite its success in such conditions, potential challenges may arise in the presence of diverse fault types and under varying load and system parameters.

5. **[5] Fault Diagnosis Without Additional Sensors:**
   The fault diagnosis technique presented in this study offers the advantage of not requiring additional sensors, enhancing its ease of implementation and minimizing costs. However, its suitability for large-scale systems and adaptability to different fault types necessitate further scrutiny to ascertain its practicality and reliability in diverse operational environments.
