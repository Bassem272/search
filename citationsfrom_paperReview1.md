Certainly! Here's a paraphrased version of the provided citations:

1. Original:
   "Distribution systems have been traditionally designed for a one-way power flow from substations to loads. DER integration with these distribution systems presents several protection challenges [2]."

   Paraphrased:
   "Historically, power distribution systems were crafted with a unidirectional flow from substations to loads. However, the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into these systems introduces a spectrum of challenges in terms of protection [2]."

2. Original:
   "In addition to the challenges that independently connected DERs present to their respective utility or grid systems, microgrids, due to the nature of their operation and embedding DERs within them, present additional challenges [8]."

   Paraphrased:
   "Beyond the hurdles posed by DERs independently linked to utility or grid systems, microgrids, with their unique operational characteristics and embedded DERs, bring forth supplementary challenges [8]."

3. Original:
   "Microgrids can have a considerable portion of their generation sourced from inverter-based DERs. A DER’s short-circuit contribution is dictated by its type, design, and controls [14–16]."

   Paraphrased:
   "A significant share of microgrid generation often emanates from DERs relying on inverters. The short-circuit impact of a DER depends on its type, design, and control parameters [14–16]."
