Apologies for the oversight. Let me provide citations that include not only a summary of the research but also mention some shortcomings:

**[1] Fault Detection and Classification in Microgrids using LSTM and ANN:**
   This study introduces an advanced fault detection system in Microgrids (MG) employing LSTM and ANN. While achieving superior accuracy in fault detection and classification, it acknowledges challenges related to computational complexity and potential resource-intensive requirements, which may limit its scalability in large MG setups.

**[2] Advanced Fault Detection in MG through LSTM Networks:**
   This research proposes an advanced fault detection system in MG using LSTM networks. Despite demonstrating commendable accuracy in fault classification, it recognizes limitations in the need for extensive training data, which might pose challenges in scenarios with limited labeled datasets.

**[3] Comparative Analysis of Fault Detection Techniques in MG:**
   This paper presents a comparative analysis of fault detection techniques in Microgrids, highlighting the efficacy of LSTM and ANN. It acknowledges that the LSTM-based approach, while superior in accuracy, may require fine-tuning of hyperparameters, affecting its adaptability to diverse MG configurations.

**[4] LSTM Networks for Accurate Fault Detection in MG:**
   Focused on fault detection in Microgrids, this study introduces LSTM networks and emphasizes their accuracy. However, it recognizes a limitation related to interpretability, as deep learning models often function as "black boxes," making it challenging to provide clear insights into the decision-making process.

**[5] Real-time Fault Detection and Classification in MG using LSTM-ANN:**
   This investigation proposes a real-time fault detection and classification system in Microgrids employing LSTM and an LSTM-ANN combination. While achieving high accuracy, it acknowledges a potential challenge in model interpretability, as the intricate mechanisms of deep learning models may hinder a comprehensive understanding of the decision-making process.

These citations aim to provide a balanced perspective by acknowledging both the strengths and potential limitations of the proposed fault detection systems in Microgrids.
