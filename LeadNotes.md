<!-- note for time computional of the fault detection --> 
## all this for the paper of: Adaptive Fault Detection Scheme Using an Optimized Self-healing Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithm:-


ge of the power system.
In the proposed method, there are no signal processing or
feature selection techniques needed, and just raw dataset (input
signal voltage, frequency and pahse angle) is used for the
predictions. Thus, the proposed method is not just specialized
for the dataset. According to the results, it is also adaptive and
flexible for any type of structure-based dataset. It is found
that the proposed method provides much greater accurate
results than individual machine learning algorithms using three
IEEE models (14 bus-39-bus and PV added). The proposed
methodâ€™s accuracy rates are calcualted as 97.93% for the
IEEE classical model and 96.68% for the modified (PV added)
model and 96.61% for the IEEE-39 bus model
<!-- good for now but not what you want ok  -->
While IEEE
1547 standards allow 2 second delays to detect any possible
faults, the proposed method obtains better results, up to 0.021 s
for the IEEE 14 bus and 0.036 s for the modified IEEE 14
bus model. This means, the computational time is almost
1% of IEEE standards which is small enough for a power
system study. Thus, the proposed method will provide higher
and faster results than the most popular machine learning
algorithms and also provides adaptivity for any structural

for the paper 9 it has a good info like: the probability of the faults is 85% for the to the ground faults

The number of cycles in which the system can respond to and clear a fault depends on the frequency (Hz) of the system. 

If the frequency is 50 Hz, then the time period (T) of one cycle is given by:

\[ T = \frac{1 \, \text{second}}{50 \, \text{Hz}} = 0.02 \, \text{seconds/cycle} \]

Now, you want to know how many cycles can occur in a .04-second time frame:

\[ \text{Cycles in .04 seconds} = \frac{0.04 \, \text{seconds}}{T} \]

Substitute the value of T:

\[ \text{Cycles in .04 seconds} = \frac{0.04 \, \text{seconds}}{0.02 \, \text{seconds/cycle}} = 2 \, \text{cycles} \]

So, in a .04-second time frame, there are approximately 2 cycles at a frequency of 50 Hz.
