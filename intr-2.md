**Introduction**

The ever-evolving landscape of technology has ushered in a new era in electricity generation, prompting a shift towards distributed generation methods. Microgrids, incorporating distributed generators linked to the main grid, stand out as a pivotal approach for integrating distributed generation. However, their implementation poses substantial challenges, including the critical need for a robust protection scheme to swiftly identify, locate, and address faults.

**Challenges Faced:**
Our endeavor encountered multifaceted challenges inherent in microgrid protection schemes:

- **Dual Flow of Power:** Microgrids, characterized by bidirectional energy flow, intensify the complexity of fault detection and localization, demanding sophisticated protection strategies.

- **Dynamic Nature of Faults:** The dynamic nature of faults in microgrids, influenced by bidirectional energy flow and distributed generators, complicates fault identification and requires innovative solutions.

- **Line-Length Disparities:** Variations in power line lengths, coupled with the presence of distributed generators, introduced nuanced challenges in fault localization accuracy, as exemplified in Line 2.

**Research Problem:**
The overarching problem addressed in this research revolves around the design and implementation of a microgrid protection scheme that effectively navigates the intricate challenges posed by bidirectional energy flow, dynamic fault scenarios, and diverse power line configurations. The dual objectives of fault identification and precise fault localization within varying microgrid contexts underscore the complexity of the research problem.

**Contributions of the Research:**
Our research makes distinct contributions to the field:

- **Advanced Fault Identification:** The research introduces an advanced microgrid protection scheme employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Tree Ensemble (DTE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Notably, the ANN demonstrates exceptional fault identification capabilities, achieving a validation accuracy of 99.3% and 100% accuracy in testing.

- **Enhanced Fault Localization:** Leveraging the strengths of LDA, the research enhances fault localization, particularly in challenging scenarios such as Line 2. The nuanced comparison of model performance provides valuable insights for tailoring protection schemes to diverse microgrid configurations.

- **Insights for Future Research:** Candid identification of challenges, including line-length disparities and the influence of distributed generators, provides a roadmap for future research. The study serves as a catalyst for refining protection schemes and addressing limitations to achieve higher accuracy in fault localization.

In navigating the intricate landscape of microgrid protection, our research not only addresses pressing challenges but also pioneers innovative solutions, laying the groundwork for more resilient and adaptive microgrid systems.
